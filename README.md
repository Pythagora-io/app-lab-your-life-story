# Your Life Story

Your Life Story is an innovative application that allows users to create captivating narratives based on uploaded images. Using the DALL-E and OpenAI APIs, the app analyzes images to generate detailed summaries, which are then used to craft engaging stories. Users can also listen to these stories narrated in a lifelike AI voice.
